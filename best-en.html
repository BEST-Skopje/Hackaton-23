                            Since 1989, BEST has been providing opportunities for communication, collaboration, and exchange among students across Europe.
                        With 95 Local BEST Groups in 33 countries, BEST forms a student network that is constantly growing, well-organized,
                        powerful, and innovative. The daily progress is owed to around 4800 enthusiastic students who actively participate,
                        and nearly 1 million students are reached through the inspired events and initiatives.
                            </br>
                            <br>
                            BEST gives students the chance to expand their knowledge on topics that complement their education by organizing
                        academic courses, engineering competitions, educational symposiums, training, and cultural exchanges.
                            </br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, BEST also aims to expand the job market through career fairs, workshops, and by operating an international
                        career center.
                            </br>
                            <br>
                            Last but not least, BEST has developed its own training system, so our members also have the opportunity to
                        enhance their skills and knowledge through technical skills and soft skills training.

                            BEST, Board of European Students of Technology, is an international non-profit and non-political student organization,
                        organized and led entirely by students. BEST connects students from 93 technical universities in 34 countries in a network
                        maintained through numerous joint projects, interests, and friendships. Each year, it organizes over 120 international
                        courses, seminars, and conferences where students from different countries learn and exchange experiences and ideas.
                            </br>
                            <br>
                            Our priority is to offer high-quality services to students throughout Europe. Thus, we bring together partners in the
                        "student - company - university" triangle. As a result of the need for increased student exchange, meeting and collaboration
                        between domestic students and colleagues from other universities, and the establishment of further education in their studies,
                        the Board of European Students of Technology - Skopje was created.
